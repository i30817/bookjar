### Bookjar ebook reader


Reads html, rtf, txt. Preserves inline html links, reformats paragraphs. Saves the index of the read books. Allows reading from rar or zip files, by a best file-match (first html variants, then rtf then txt). Download books from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page), and covers from [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/).

If your ebook files are divided into many sub-files or in a format that the reader doesn't read use [calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert (mobi or epub can be converted to htmlz and that works).
